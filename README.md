<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  We present SCube, a novel method for reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes (geometry, appearance, and semantics) from a sparse set of posed images. Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat, which is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates high-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians with a 1024^3 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views. We show the superiority of SCube compared to prior art using the Waymo self-driving dataset on 3D reconstruction and demonstrate its applications, such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  Reconstructing and understanding 3D structures from a limited number of images is a well-established problem in computer vision. Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity.
In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.

### 3. [CVPR '2024] DUSt3R: Geometric 3D Vision Made Easy
**Authors**: Shuzhe Wang, Vincent Leroy, Yohann Cabon, Boris Chidlovskii, Jerome Revaud
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  Multi-view stereo reconstruction (MVS) in the wild requires to first estimate the camera parameters e.g. intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain, yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space, which is the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work, we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R, a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections, i.e. operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps, relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided, we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders, allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information, but interestingly, we can seamlessly recover from it, pixel matches, relative and absolute camera. Exhaustive experiments on all these tasks showcase that the proposed DUSt3R can unify various 3D vision tasks and set new SoTAs on monocular/multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation. In summary, DUSt3R makes many geometric 3D vision tasks easy.

### 4. [Arxiv '2024] Grounding Image Matching in 3D with MASt3R
**Authors**: Vincent Leroy, Yohann Cabon, Jérôme Revaud
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  Image Matching is a core component of all best-performing algorithms and pipelines in 3D vision. Yet despite matching being fundamentally a 3D problem, intrinsically linked to camera pose and scene geometry, it is typically treated as a 2D problem. This makes sense as the goal of matching is to establish correspondences between 2D pixel fields, but also seems like a potentially hazardous choice. In this work, we take a different stance and propose to cast matching as a 3D task with DUSt3R, a recent and powerful 3D reconstruction framework based on Transformers. Based on pointmaps regression, this method displayed impressive robustness in matching views with extreme viewpoint changes, yet with limited accuracy. We aim here to improve the matching capabilities of such an approach while preserving its robustness. We thus propose to augment the DUSt3R network with a new head that outputs dense local features, trained with an additional matching loss. We further address the issue of quadratic complexity of dense matching, which becomes prohibitively slow for downstream applications if not carefully treated. We introduce a fast reciprocal matching scheme that not only accelerates matching by orders of magnitude, but also comes with theoretical guarantees and, lastly, yields improved results. Extensive experiments show that our approach, coined MASt3R, significantly outperforms the state of the art on multiple matching tasks. In particular, it beats the best published methods by 30% (absolute improvement) in VCRE AUC on the extremely challenging Map-free localization dataset.

### 5. [Arxiv '2024] MonST3R: A Simple Approach for Estimating Geometry in the Presence of Motion
**Authors**: Junyi Zhang, Charles Herrmann, Junhwa Hur, Varun Jampani, Trevor Darrell, Forrester Cole, Deqing Sun, Ming-Hsuan Yang
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  Estimating geometry from dynamic scenes, where objects move and deform over time, remains a core challenge in computer vision. Current approaches often rely on multi-stage pipelines or global optimizations that decompose the problem into subtasks, like depth and flow, leading to complex systems prone to errors. In this paper, we present Motion DUSt3R (MonST3R), a novel geometry-first approach that directly estimates per-timestep geometry from dynamic scenes. Our key insight is that by simply estimating a pointmap for each timestep, we can effectively adapt DUST3R's representation, previously only used for static scenes, to dynamic scenes. However, this approach presents a significant challenge: the scarcity of suitable training data, namely dynamic, posed videos with depth labels. Despite this, we show that by posing the problem as a fine-tuning task, identifying several suitable datasets, and strategically training the model on this limited data, we can surprisingly enable the model to handle dynamics, even without an explicit motion representation. Based on this, we introduce new optimizations for several downstream video-specific tasks and demonstrate strong performance on video depth and camera pose estimation, outperforming prior work in terms of robustness and efficiency. Moreover, MonST3R shows promising results for primarily feed-forward 4D reconstruction.

### 6. [CVPR '2024 Oral, Best Paper Runner-Up] pixelSplat: 3D Gaussian Splats from Image Pairs for Scalable Generalizable 3D Reconstruction
**Authors**: David Charatan, Sizhe Li, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Vincent Sitzmann
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  We introduce pixelSplat, a feed-forward model that learns to reconstruct 3D radiance fields parameterized by 3D Gaussian primitives from pairs of images. Our model features real-time and memory-efficient rendering for scalable training as well as fast 3D reconstruction at inference time. To overcome local minima inherent to sparse and locally supported representations, we predict a dense probability distribution over 3D and sample Gaussian means from that probability distribution. We make this sampling operation differentiable via a reparameterization trick, allowing us to back-propagate gradients through the Gaussian splatting representation. We benchmark our method on wide-baseline novel view synthesis on the real-world RealEstate10k and ACID datasets, where we outperform state-of-the-art light field transformers and accelerate rendering by 2.5 orders of magnitude while reconstructing an interpretable and editable 3D radiance field.

### 7. [ECCV '2024 Oral] MVSplat: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images
**Authors**: Yuedong Chen, Haofei Xu, Chuanxia Zheng, Bohan Zhuang, Marc Pollefeys, Andreas Geiger, Tat-Jen Cham, Jianfei Cai
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  We introduce MVSplat, an efficient model that, given sparse multi-view images as input, predicts clean feed-forward 3D Gaussians. To accurately localize the Gaussian centers, we build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the cost volume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We also learn other Gaussian primitives' parameters jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying on photometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volume representation in learning feed-forward Gaussians via extensive experimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks, MVSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forward inference speed (22~fps). More impressively, compared to the latest state-of-the-art method pixelSplat, MVSplat uses 10× fewer parameters and infers more than 2× faster while providing higher appearance and geometry quality as well as better cross-dataset generalization.

### 8. [Arxiv '2024] DepthSplat: Connecting Gaussian Splatting and Depth
**Authors**: Haofei Xu, Songyou Peng, Fangjinhua Wang, Hermann Blum, Daniel Barath, Andreas Geiger, Marc Pollefeys
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  Gaussian splatting and single/multi-view depth estimation are typically studied in isolation. In this paper, we present DepthSplat to connect Gaussian splatting and depth estimation and study their interactions. More specifically, we first contribute a robust multi-view depth model by leveraging pre-trained monocular depth features, leading to high-quality feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting reconstructions. We also show that Gaussian splatting can serve as an unsupervised pre-training objective for learning powerful depth models from large-scale unlabelled datasets. We validate the synergy between Gaussian splatting and depth estimation through extensive ablation and cross-task transfer experiments. Our DepthSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets in terms of both depth estimation and novel view synthesis, demonstrating the mutual benefits of connecting both tasks.
